// GENERICS
/// This is just for Understanding

// Generics allow you to create reusable and type-safe components that work with any data type without losing information about that type.
// Why use Generics?

// 1.  Reusability – Write once, work with any type.
// 2. Type safety – Prevents accidental type errors.
// 3. Better code readability.
